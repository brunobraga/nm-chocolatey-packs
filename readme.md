# Chocolatey Packs #
A collection of [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) packages 

`Build.ps1` compiles all packages and places them in the `.artifacts` folder

`Push.ps1` Queries Chocolatey for the latest published version and pushes any packages that are not up to date

## SQL Server Packages
The SQL Server chocolatey packages were rejected from chocolatey.org since they cannot run without a user specified path to an ISO image. They are available from a public myget feed: [https://www.myget.org/F/nm-chocolatey-packs/api/v2](https://www.myget.org/F/nm-chocolatey-packs/api/v2)

See my [boxstarter script](https://github.com/neutmute/nm-boxstarter/blob/master/base-box.ps1) for example code on how to execute them as well as the package `readme.md` files
